The Laser Turret uses a webcam to track objects and then shoots a laser in the direction of the tracked object. The goal of is to process the images taken by the webcam and, using the results that comes from processing the images, control the servo motors appropriately to direct the beam of laser at the object. In the time given, we were able to accomplish the goals that we set for ourselves. Using only the gumstix board, we were able to successfully interface with the webcam and process the images taken. We were also able to provide the proper pulse width modulations to the servo motors to correctly aim the laser at the target that the webcam processed.
