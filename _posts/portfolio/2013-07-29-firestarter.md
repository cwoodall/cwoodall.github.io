Firestarter v1 was designed to open a pyro valve, preheat the fuel grain, and monitor the combustion chamber and N2O tank pressures for the <a href="http://www.burocket.org/">BU Rocket Propulsion Group</a>'s MkIII hybrid rocket engine. The pressure readings are all from full bridge pressure transducers which go through an instrumentation amplifier, 4th order Butterwirth filter and into an ADC. The board communicates to the world through and RS-422 connection and runs on STM32 Cortex-M3 microcontroller. More explicit information is not available due to various restrictions.

A new revision of the board is being worked on by Thomas Nadovich and Dean DiCarli for the MkIV rocket engine.
