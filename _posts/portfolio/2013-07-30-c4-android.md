Have you ever wanted to Connect Four red or blue disks on a yellow background? Now is your chance! This implementation of the fun and traditional game utilizes the Android NDK, a C++ backend and the native Java SDK.

Play single player, against a silly AI, or against a Friend in an epic duel of the whits.
