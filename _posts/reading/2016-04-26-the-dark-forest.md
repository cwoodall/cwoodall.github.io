*The Dark Forest by Cixin Liu* was a thought-provoking book which I think really
does glimpse into the darkness of civilization, and humanity. There is some
subtle optimism presented throughout the book which puts much faith in humanity's (and other civilizations'). However, there is also a darkness which is presented which is
a disturbing answer to the Fermi paradox. It is thought provoking and really makes
you contemplate humanity's place in the universe.
