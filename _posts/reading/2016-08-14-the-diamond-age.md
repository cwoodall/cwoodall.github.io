[*The Diamond Age*](http://amzn.to/2eS6Bcr) by Neal Stephenson inspects some interesting topics in nano-technology,
tribal societies, and in many ways is a spiritual successor to Snow Crash in that the
general structure of the world is similar. Personally I enjoyed the portion of the book
about the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer and Nell, which explores what can happen
when an underprivileged individual comes into contact with a technology built around
educating and raising children to be strong individuals. The book sort of becomes a little
stale towards the end, the Seed is an interesting technology, but never quite makes sense
and the Drummers and the story that unfolds around them, The Fists of Righteous Harmony,
and John Hackworth (the inventor of the Primer) feels somewhat forced. Like many other
Stephenson books, the ending leaves you wanting more, but the world he has constructed is
interesting enough to satisfy. Think of the book more as a thought experiment in how
tribal societies interact, nano-technology, and a series of other concepts rather than
a concrete story and it will be an enjoyable ride.
