[Neil Gaiman's][neil-gaiman] [Norse Mythology][amazon] is retelling of
the myths of the Norse God's focusing mainly on: Thor, Loki, Odin, Freya
and Frey. I listend to the audiobook, narrated by Neil Gaiman, which I
thought was well done, and felt personal. The stories are engaging
and well told. The book approaches the perfect
blend of myth and narrative, and it extends from being a creative work
in its own right. The myths are accessible, but still they leave a
strong impression, and a strong curiosity to learn more about the bizarre
world of the Norse gods, and their massive flaws. I highly reccomend
reading this to anyone who liked [American God's][american-gods], since
it indirectly fleshes out of the characters in that book (who are
themselves based on Norse myth).
