_[Good Omens]_ is a collaboration between [Terry Pratchett] and [Neil Gaiman]
which I listened to as an audiobook. A humorous, satirical and biting novel
about the apocalypse, starring a demon who is not so bad, an angel who is not
so good, and an anti-christ who just wants to play with his friends. I found it
to be hilarious, with a lot of funny social and religious commentary. The book
feels mostly like Terry Pratchett, with a little bit of the unique darkness Neil
Gaiman brings; however, I think the collaboration was very successful. While 
Pratchett's voice overpowers Neil's, the real benefit seems to have been Gaiman
feeling more comfortable writing books. 

The book goes fast, and I think having humor about the end times is both necessary and
health. So if you find yourself needing a little bit of levity, and maybe some
"faith" in humanities desire to keep on being, I would read or listen to 
Good Omens. And remember, any accurate prophesy must be uselessly vague and banal
because context is not included and cannot be presented to the one making the 
prophesy
