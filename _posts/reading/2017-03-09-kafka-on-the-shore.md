[Haruki Murakami]'s _[Kafka on the Shore]_ is an elegantly written book 
filled with heady references and a magical-realism which penetrates this
abstract reinterpretation of Oedipus Rex. The setting is outstanding,
describing not just Japan, but all of the subtly magical pieces of the
world. The spiritual becomes an integral part of the novel, and nothing
is literal. It stretches your mind as a seemingly direct prophecy is 
carried out through the most abstract and dream-like of means. There 
is a lot of really hard to handle content, as the main
character develops and is not always the best person. However, he seems
to learn who he is, and a bit of empathy by the end as the hero's
journey comes to a close. Well written and worth it, but it can be a
little dense at times, which I enjoyed but others might not.
