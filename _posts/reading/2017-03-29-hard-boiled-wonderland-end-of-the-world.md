_[Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of The World]_ by [Haruki Murakami] 
involves 2 parallel, seemingly unrelated stories, which become more and more
intertwined as the stories develop. One of them takes place in a cyberpunk
like future, with humans who act as encryption/decryption services, and the
other in a surreal fantasy land where your shadow is removed from you and
you can't leave. The story is intriguing and I can't discuss it much more
without spoiling, but I found it to be thought provoking and it was a 
little bit of a smoother read than other Murakami books, but still had all
of the beautiful and delicate language which Murakami does so well.
