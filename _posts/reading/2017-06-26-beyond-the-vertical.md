_[Beyond The Vertical]_ by [Layton Kor] follows the climbing career from
childhood into old age of the author. The format of the book is a series of
short vignettes of different climbing trips from a wide variety of Layton's
partners (including Steve Roper, Jim McCarthy and Royal Robbins) glued
together by Layton's own recounting of his climbing career.
The descriptions of their approach to climbing, and the shear sense of adventure
that compelled them inspires me as a human and as a climber. Layton's major
contributions were to Colorado climbing at Eldorado Canyon, Long's Peak and
The Black Canyon of the Gunnison. He also put up bold climbs in Yosemite,
the Dolomites and elsewhere making himself into a climbing legend.

I think this book will inspire any climber, but might be dull to a  non-climber.
Some of the most interesting passages are actually about the logistics, strategies,
and techniques used to make the climbs possible. Some of the inventions, such
as Royal Robbins' jumar based haul systems, new pieces of protection, and the
logistics of big wall climbing, enabled new climbs which would have
been impossible. This history of climbing grew my appreciation
for the boldness and adventurousness of those who came before. Now to repeat
a Layton Kor route! Maybe one of the following:

- [The Yellow Spur](https://www.mountainproject.com/v/105748657?search=1&type=route&method=resultsPage&query=the%20Yellow%20Spur)

This book inspired me to collect some data from [Mountain Project][mp] and
create webstite that maps the first ascents of various climbers. [Check it out][wcw]!
