_[A Wizard of Earthsea]_ by [Ursula K. Le Guin]  is a fun fantasy novel aimed at young adults and teens. It
follows a wizard named Ged/Sparrowhawk as he tries to get rid of an evil he brought into the world through
his own arrogance. It is well written and enjoyable, like _Left Hand of Darkness_ the world building is 
superb and is given to you in little shards as you need to know about it. The lessons of the book are deep
and there is a lot to learn from the character development of Ged, as he learns to be more humble and to 
live life rather than run from death.
