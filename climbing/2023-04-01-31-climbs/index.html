So I went down to MetroRock in Essex, VT and spent about 5 hours in the gym getting my 31 climbs together with support from friends and loved ones. To plan I started by listing out some rules:</p><ul><li>Climb on ropes only or if doing boulders you need to link to rope length.</li><li>Climbing up and down counts as 2 pitches.</li><li>All climbing grades 5.6 and above are in</li><li>Every 5 climbs you need to do something 5.10a or greater.</li><li>Falls are ok, but you must get to the top of the climb without cheating past moves for it to count.</li><li>You must finish the climb an uncompleted climb does not count</li><li>Auto-belays are good to go.</li><li>No more than 4 repeats of a single route.</li></ul><p><img src=/img/posts/climbing/2023-04-01-31-climbs/1.jpg alt></p><p>I then thought through some strategy</p><ul><li>Concentrate on number of pitches, no more than 4 repeats.</li><li>Have enough people such that I can always climb.</li><li>Choose routes that minimize tie-ins.</li><li>Keep going, take rests when you can and don&rsquo;t let yourself get pumped out of your mind</li><li>Stretch periodically.</li><li>Eat plenty of food</li></ul><p>As I went through the climbs I ended up doing about 4-8 climbs in a single push. In between these pushes I would take a longer rest. During these rests I would stretch, drink water, eat food, belay my climbing partners and go on walks. This left a nice casual feel to the day. However, over the last few climbs I started to get more and more tired. I would sweat profusely when I got to the ground after climbing 5.8, and I started to have a dull ache in my forearms.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/climbing/2023-04-01-31-climbs/2.jpg alt></p><p>Overall, I averaged a grade of about 5.8-/5.7+. I did manage to pull off one 5.10a or higher every 5 climbs, and I finished all 31 climbs. This was a great challenge, and I would love to do it again. Overall, it was easier than I thought; mostly just focus, commitment and community were all I needed.</p><p>For the nerds here are some stats.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/climbing/2023-04-01-31-climbs/3.png alt></p><p>Thanks all who came out to celebrate my birthday and support me.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher><small>Built with Hugo and the Hugo Researcher Theme</small></a></div></div></body></html>
