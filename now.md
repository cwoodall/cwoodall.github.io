## What am I doing _now_?

I am spending a lot of my time working at Barrett Technology which is currently
a priority for me. I have also been climbing at [Brookyln Boulders](http://brooklynboulders.com)
and outside at Farley, Crow Hill and in N. Conway. Hiking has been a growing interest
for me and I hope to snag a few more peaks before winter and do some winter hiking.

Recently I went through some of my older music and found some cool stuff! You should
check out what I [posted](/music.html).

### My priorities are:

- Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Barrett Technology. Doing some work on
  building a good embedded workflow, and a solid API base for us.
- Climbing and enjoying Rocktober! I did Pinnacle Buttress which was an amazing experience.
- Reading about Bletchley Park, Ultra and Enigma   
  [(Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Seizing-Enigma-German-U-Boats-1939-1943/dp/0395427398).
  You can always see whats on my reading list on [trello](https://trello.com/b/9l0rYMxD/reading-list)
- Finishing an LED project for a tap dance my significant other is working on.
  - It involves Arduinos, nrf24 radios and some RGB LED strips. Some code is available on [Github](https://github.com/cwoodall/flicker-lights). I hope to write up some more when
	the time allows.
- Learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) and trying to aid in the [embedded-rust](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-rust/blob/scope/text/0000-scope.md) RFC effort.
- Appreciating life, journaling, and learning a little about [Stoicism](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614) and other philosophies of life.
