Reflecting on 2019, it was a crazy year with a lot to learn on a personal level.
I am now in Burlington, VT working at BETA Technologies on the future of electric aviation! My main focus is on inverters for controlling motors. This is taking up most of my time.
I have been meditating daily (using a combination of Unified Mindfulness and Sam Harris' Waking Up app), trying to do daily creative acts (water colors, music, programming, etc), and when I can going to yoga.</description></item></channel></rss>
