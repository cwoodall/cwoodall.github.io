<img src=/img/projects/sx86-emulator/proj.jpg style=max-width:100%><p><p>While at BU I had an assignment for a class called EC327 which used a 16-bit
RISC processor that the professors called &ldquo;simplified x86&rdquo;, also referred to as
sx86. This was a very basic assembler, and the tool at the time was written in
java, but had some issues with copying code in and out of the program requiring
that you hand copy the code. To make my debugging easier I implemented an emulator
in Javascript (it should be a valid node.js program), and then a front end to
view the data. I had also written a python script to assemble and dissassemble
these instructions and later integrated a TA for the classes code with mine to
create a CGI based set of calls to assemble and dissassemble the code. I learned
a whole lot more from this project than I would have otherwise, just converting
some machine code by hand and chugging along. This website was used by EC327 for
one or two years after the fact (and may still be today, I have no idea).</p></p><br><br></div><div class="flex-column p-0"><b><a href=/projects/2013-07-30-16-channel-floating-dac/>16 Channel 12-bit Floating Fine Adjustment DAC | 2013-08-28 | ELECTRONICS</b></h3><br><a href>Video</a> | <a href>Documentation</a> | <a href>Source</a><br>Jeffrey Kittredge | Gaukhar Tergemessova | Mark Horenstein | Kritpasitpong Benjathatchaporn | Chris Woodall

The kits purpose was to help teach a group of female high school freshmen in the <a href=http://www.bu.edu/lernet/artemis/>Artemis</a> summer program how to solder. Assembly was designed to take between 2 and 4 hours for a beginner, but should take closer to 30 minutes for someone with prior experience.</p><p>The synthesizer utilizes an ATMega328 and a 12-bit DAC to produce the audio, in its default mode you can play 4 different 8 note scales. There is also a sequencer mode and an ability to change the waveform. To load sequences and new waveforms the <a href=http://cwoodall.github.io/artemis-synth>optoloader</a> interface is used, which uses javascript to blink a black square on a computer screen and a phototransistor to receive this message, which is then decoded on the microcontroller.</p></p><br><br></div><div class="flex-column p-0"><b><a href=/projects/2013-07-29-ttt/>TTT: TTC TTS Tester for CMS and G minus 2 | 2013-06-30 | ELECTRONICS</b></h3><br><a href>Video</a> | <a href>Documentation</a> | <a href=http://ohm.bu.edu/~cwoodall/TTT/firmware/archive/2013-06-14_TTT_firmware_ISE13_3.tar.gz>Source</a><br>Eric Hazen | Charlie Hill | Chris Woodall

This allows for configurations to be set, such as, running off of an external clock. The board to board communications are done over a fiber optic interface and the Spartan-6 chip decodes an 80MHz BiPhase Mark Coded datastream which multiplexes two datastreams together.</p></p><br><br></div><div class="flex-column p-0"><b><a href=/projects/2013-07-27-analog-synth-ec412/>Monophonic Analog Synthesizer with AR Enveloping | 2013-04-21 | ELECTRONICS</b></h3><br><a href>Video</a> | <a href=/pdf/ec412-final-report.pdf>Documentation</a> | <a href=https://github.com/cwoodall/ec412-analog-audio-synth>Source</a><br>Benjamin Havey | Chris Woodall
<img src=/img/projects/analog-synth-ec412/analog-synth-ec412.jpg style=max-width:100%><p><p>This Monophonic Analog Synthesizer was designed by Christopher Woodall and Benjamin Havey. The synthesizer uses a homemade linearly actuated potentiometer as its input, a long with a button for articulation. The potentiometer voltage is fed through a linear to exponential converter and then a voltage controlled oscillator. The output of the VCO is then put through a analog multiplier designed using an opamp and discrete transistors which envelopes the square and triangle wave VCO outputs with a attack release (AR) envelope. The enveloped output is then filtered, amplified and pumped through speakers. Each piece of the synthesizer was simulated in LTSpice and then built on a breadboard.</p></p><br><br></div><div class="flex-column p-0"><b><a href=/projects/2013-07-26-laser-turret-for-ec535/>Object Detecting Laser Turret | 2013-04-20 | ELECTRONICS</b></h3><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1tBLELajWU">Video</a> | <a href=/pdf/laser-turret-doc.pdf>Documentation</a> | <a href>Source</a><br>Jenny Hoac | Jonah Lou | Chris Woodall

The goal of is to process the images taken by the webcam and, using the results that comes from processing the images, control the servo motors appropriately to direct the beam of laser at the object. In the time given, we were able to accomplish the goals that we set for ourselves. Using only the gumstix board, we were able to successfully interface with the webcam and process the images taken. We were also able to provide the proper pulse width modulations to the servo motors to correctly aim the laser at the target that the webcam processed.</p></p><br><br></div><div class="flex-column p-0"><b><a href=/projects/2013-07-29-firestarter/>Firestarter v1: Hybrid Rocket Pressure Monitor &amp;amp; Igniter | 2013-03-15 | ELECTRONICS</b></h3><br><a href>Video</a> | <a href>Documentation</a> | <a href>Source</a><br>Chris Woodall

The pressure readings are all from full bridge pressure transducers which go through an instrumentation amplifier, 4th order Butterwirth filter and into an ADC.

<img src=/img/projects/nomis/nomis.jpg style=max-width:100%><p><p>Nomis is a Simon-like memory game for the ATTiny85, which uses the ATTiny85. The game logic in the ATTiny85 was implemented using AVR C and takes up 983 bytes in program memory and 6 bytes in data memory. The implementation size comes in under 1kB, but could most certainly be smaller. The pin usage, however, is very conservative and the games electronics take up a total of 4 of the 6 available pins. The 4 LEDs are controlled on 3 pins using Charlieplexing model (which could easily be extended to 6 LEDs). On the other hand the 4 pushbutton switches are feed into an ADC input through an R2R ladder configuration. I am very happy with the limited pin usage of this project.</p></p><br><br></div></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher><small>Built with Hugo and the Hugo Researcher Theme</small></a></div></div></body></html>
