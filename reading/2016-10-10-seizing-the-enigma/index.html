electro-mechanical cipher system used by the German&rsquo;s during WWII, and <em>ULTRA</em>
the British code breaking effort of the <em>ENIGMA</em> (and other Axis encodings and
encipherments). Daniel Kahn is a leading historian of cryptographic history and
it shows in his ability to stitch together a story which does not focus on one
person (such as Turing or Welchman), but instead covers the German&rsquo;s, the navy,
and Bletchley Park (the headquarters of the British code breakers). The descriptions
of the encoding, and code breaking methods, are easy to follow. However, the real
point the book drives home is how pure mathematical analysis is important, but
it in a problem like cryptography it can prove that something is &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo;
to break, without taking into account implementation, and human, details which
change the mathematical facts. The breaking of the <em>ENIGMA</em> is a beautiful interplay
between mathematical rigor, engineering, espionage and social reasoning. I think
this will change the way I think about problems going forward. This applies not
just in the domain of cryptography, but also safety of systems which have high
consequence. A mathematically provably safe system can be useful, but it is
the social aspects and variables that were not controlled for that can still
cause issues and incidents! This is not to say that we should not provide rigor,
but instead that mathematical and engineering rigor are a basis, and that data
collection and skepticism are necessary to improve and maintain a system.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher><small>Built with Hugo and the Hugo Researcher Theme</small></a></div></div></body></html>
