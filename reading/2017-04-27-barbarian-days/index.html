authors obsession with surfing, from his childhood to adulthood with a
long section of being a surf bum in between. I have never surfed, but I
found myself being dragged into the lingo and culture and really yearning
in a way for that open life adventure. For me climbing fits a similar role
in my life, I know to some degree it is pointless, yet I come back to it and
it keeps providing something for me. This is Finnegan&rsquo;s well of inspiration,
even at those periods where he leaves the sport, and each time he comes back
it brings him something new.</p><p>Another thing that <em>Barbarian Days&rsquo;s</em> highlights are the characters who find
themselves so hopelessly entrenched in an activity like surfing. They are
strange, often brilliant, individuals from a variety places. Some of them
are professors, doctors, and intellectuals, and some are railroad workers;
however, all of them become overwhelmed with their desire to surf. This
book is not just a surfing book, it is a book about obsession, life and
passion. I also enjoyed the deep intuition for waves and form which surfing
gave Finnegan, and he is able to portray through the book.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher><small>Built with Hugo and the Hugo Researcher Theme</small></a></div></div></body></html>
