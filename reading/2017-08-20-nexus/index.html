future, where technology has been created to link human minds, and possibly
control them. Naam inspects different social impacts of these technologies
ranging from the most profound and inspirational uses (such as building new
levels of empath and human connection) to the most disturbing and dark abuses
(such as making it trivial to coerce people). The technology seems and feels
plausible throughout the novel, besides towards the end where a few flimsy
cyberpunk-esque plot devices are used to move the story forward. I also enjoyed
the inspection of the technology through different lenses, such as, a Buddhist
perspective in addition to a Silicon Valley hot shot perspective.</p><p>On the downside I found some of the writing to be bland, the characters to be
flat, and the plot to be uninspiring; however, the book makes you think about a
new technology in a very deep way. This is it&rsquo;s redeeming factor and is what
makes it into a great sci-fi book. I would recommend it if you are interested in
the idea of human brains being linked through networks of nanobots. I would
especially recommend this book if you liked the Drummers side-plot of <a href=http://cwoodall.com/reading/2016/08/14/the-diamond-age.html><em>The Diamond Age</em> by Neal Stephenson</a></p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher><small>Built with Hugo and the Hugo Researcher Theme</small></a></div></div></body></html>
