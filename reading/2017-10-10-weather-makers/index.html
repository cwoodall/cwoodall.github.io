<p><em><a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008RZKO6A>The Weather Makers</a></em> by <a href=http://www.timflannery.com/>Tim Flannery</a> is a frightening and enlightening book about global warming. Though it is about 10 years old at this point it had a few major points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The evidence for human linked global warming is very strong (and has only become stronger)</li>
<li>The reduction in biodiversity is intense, and probably irreversible; we have changed climates and biomes and there is probably no going back.</li>
<li>There is no silver bullet, we need all nations to collaborate and the issues are largely policy issues. However, individual contributions are larger than I thought and in aggregate can improve the situation dramatically. These issues can be made easier with appropriate application of technology (electric cars, solar panels, etc.)</li>
<li>A benefit of a green energy economy is that it can wrestle the production of power from corporations to communities, through town owned infrastructure (wind), and personal ownership (solar).</li>
<li>Coal is the enemy, other forms of carbon emissions are more efficient and thus slightly less problematic.</li>
<li>There is some hope&mldr;</li>
</ol>
<p>I need to continue studying these issues, I think it can make a major impact on my habits and push me to try to get more involved.</p>
