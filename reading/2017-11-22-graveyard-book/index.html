    <p>I started listening to <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0011UJM48">The Graveyard Book</a></em> by <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman</a> while I was in JFK airport in NY.
I had missed a connecting flight and was alone in the airport for those early morning hours where
the bustling of the airport stops. The ambiance of the airport fit the tone of the book. I really
enjoyed the story-telling. Part of it was that the Audible full-cast production was very well
done and the writing style fits an audiobook. Each chapter is a story in and of itself, and the
book follows Nobody, a boy who is being brought up by ghosts in a graveyard. He learns things
which are not typical, but through this he is able to overcome the challenges which prevent him
from living a normal life. It is a beautiful coming of age story, and touches not just on the
heroic, but also some of the ambiguity and evil which is inherent in living a life.</p>
